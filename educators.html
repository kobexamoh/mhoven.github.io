        <p class="lede">I was a schoolteacher before becoming a professor.</p>
        <p>
          I taught at St. Augustine’s elementary school in Ponoka, AB, and John Paul II high school in Ft. Saskatchewan, AB. I attended a great little public school in rural Alberta—David Thompson High School—but gravitated to Catholic schooling because of my religious background. I like collaborating with local schools now as a professor, whether something as simple as taking students on a field trip to Ben Calf Robe School here in Edmonton, or completing qualitative research with local students and educators. I like staying connected to schools out of my own interest and for my current students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a part of St. Joseph’s College, I’m fortunate to liaison with local districts. We host an annual event called, “Dinner and a Course,” which is a knock-off of “Dinner and a Movie.” It’s great to see local educators share a meal together at the College, and then engage one of our instructors on a topic relevant to their professional concerns.  We also arrange an annual job fair with Catholic school districts and have hosted or co-hosted events locally.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2015, I began teaching in an educational leadership program in the Faculty of Education. The Masters’ of Education (MES) program has reinvigorated my teaching because I get to work with driven educational leaders and engage leadership research. Teaching condensed summer cohort courses puts everything else on hold, but reminds me of the power of teacher-leaders.

          I’ve also been able to write high school modules about sport and spirituality—thanks to the financial support of Edmonton Catholic Schools. <a href="mailto:hoven@ualberta.ca">Email me</a> and I’ll send them to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are looking for a speaker on topics of religious education, sport and spirituality, sport and religion, or catholic education, then perhaps I can help. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> about a date and your expectations.
