        <p class="lede">I have a heart for education, especially Catholic education.</p>

        <p>
          I’ve taught at St. Augustine’s Elementary School in Ponoka, AB, and John Paul II High School in Ft. Saskatchewan, AB. I attended a great little public school in rural Alberta--David Thompson High School--but found that I really liked how Catholic schools could more fully embrace a faith dimension as an educational community. I like collaborating with local schools now as a professor, whether something as simple as taking students on a field trip to Ben Calf Robe School here in Edmonton, or writing sport and spirituality modules for local Catholic high schools. I like staying connected to the local education scene, especially because it helps my students learn about education in Alberta.

          Being a part of St. Joseph’s College, I’m fortunate to liaison with local Catholic districts.  We host an annual event called “Dinner and a Course” that is a simple knock-off of “Dinner and a Movie.”  It’s great to see local educators share a meal together at the College and then engage one of our instructors on a topic relevant for professional educators. We also host an annual job fair with Catholic school districts and have hosted or co-hosted events locally.

          In 2015, I began teaching in an educational leadership program in the Faculty of Education.  The Masters’ of Education (MES) program has reinvigorated my teaching because I get to work with educational leaders who are driven to make a difference in our province and beyond.  Teaching courses in this program is intense but life-giving and affirming of the power of teacher-leaders.

          One of the neatest things I’ve been able to do as a professor is to write high school modules about sport and spirituality. Anyone is free to use them--thanks to financial support from Edmonton Catholic Schools.
