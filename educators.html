          I taught at St. Augustine’s elementary school in Ponoka, AB, and John Paul II high school in Ft. Saskatchewan, AB. I attended a great little public school in rural Alberta—David Thompson high school—but gravitated to Catholic schooling because of my religious background. I like collaborating with local schools now as a professor, whether something as simple as taking students on a field trip to Ben Calf Robe School here in Edmonton, or completing qualitative research with local students and educators. I like staying connected to schools.

          Being a part of St. Joseph’s College, I’m fortunate to liaison with local districts. We host an annual event called, “Dinner and a Course,” which is a knock-off of “Dinner and a Movie.” It’s great to see local educators share a meal together at the College, and then engage one of our instructors on a topic relevant to their professional concerns. We also arrange an annual job fair with Catholic school districts and have hosted or co-hosted events locally.

          In 2015, I began teaching in an educational leadership program in the Faculty of Education. The Masters’ of Education (MES) program has reinvigorated my teaching because I get to work with driven educational leaders and engage leadership research. Teaching condensed summer cohort courses puts everything else on hold, but reminds me of the power of teacher-leaders. Furthermore, sitting on doctoral and master's committees in the Faculty has also been of great value for my own teaching and learning.

          I’ve been able to write high school modules about sport and spirituality—thanks to the financial support of Edmonton Catholic Schools. <a href="mailto:hoven@ualberta.ca">Email me</a> and I’ll send them to you.
