        <p class="lede">I was a schoolteacher before becoming a professor.</p>

        <p>
          I taught at St. Augustine’s elementary school in Ponoka, AB, and John Paul II high school in Ft. Saskatchewan, AB. I attended a great little public school in rural Alberta--David Thompson High School--but found that I liked how catholic schools could more fully embrace a faith dimension as an educational community. I like collaborating with local schools now as a professor, whether something as simple as taking students on a field trip to Ben Calf Robe School here in Edmonton, or writing sport and spirituality modules for local catholic high schools. I like staying connected to the local education scene out of interest and for my students.

          Being a part of St. Joseph’s College, I’m fortunate to liaison with local catholic districts. We host an annual event called, “Dinner and a Course,” which is a knock-off of “Dinner and a Movie.” It’s great to see local educators share a meal together at the College, and then engage one of our instructor’s on a topic relevant for professional educators. We also host an annual job fair with catholic school districts and have hosted or co-hosted events locally.

          In 2015, I began teaching in an educational leadership program in the Faculty of Education. The Masters’ of Education (MES) program has reinvigorated my teaching because I get to work with educational leaders who are driven to make a difference in our province and beyond. Teaching courses in this program is intense and inspiring, affirming for me the power of teacher-leaders.

          One of the neatest things I’ve been able to do as a professor is to write high school modules about sport and spirituality--thanks to the financial support of <a href="https://www.ecsd.net/Pages/default.aspx">Edmonton Catholic Schools</a>.
