          <p class="lede">This is me in a nutshell, minus my love of biking, my pretending to be a handyman--(don’t ever look too closely)--and my inability to speak French (as reported by my young children).</p>

          <p>
            I was raised in rural, central Alberta. I had family throughout the countryside, many of whom were schoolteachers and many of whom liked sports. We also lived next door to the local Catholic church, so our family set up Sunday Mass, mowed the church lawn, and hosted priests for a nightcap after a Lenten penitential service. Being Catholic was woven into the fabric of my life, and now looking back I realize just how unique this situation was for my generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I liked school growing up, especially playing competitive sports in junior and senior high school, and so it was no surprise when I earned my education degree at the U of A and became a schoolteacher. My interest in religion led to theological studies that culminated in getting my doctorate in religious education at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C., in 2011. I was pleased to be hired at <a href="http://www.stjosephs.ualberta.ca/">St. Joseph's College at UAlberta</a> because as an undergraduate, I had hung out at the small college: a farm kid seeking out a supportive, faith-engaged community--like the one I was raised in.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the College asked me to add “Sport and Religion” to my teaching schedule, I was floored:
          </p>

          <p class="lede">"You want me to teach undergrads about two of the things I like most--really?!?"</p>

          <p>
            My interest in this field has deepened and I incorporate this area of study into my work as a religious educator. Overall, I am happy to work at the College and University, to think and talk about religion, sport, and education all day. That’s the really cool thing about my job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I couldn’t be who I am without the support of my family--my wife, Crystal, our children, my parents and in-laws, extended family, friends, and the different communities I am a part of.
