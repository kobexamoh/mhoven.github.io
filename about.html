          <p class="lede">Sports, religion and education: they interested me in my youth and still inspire me today.</p>

          <p>
            I was raised in rural central Alberta with an extended family who loved sports and many of whom were schoolteachers.  We also lived next door to the local catholic church, so our family was responsible to set up for Mass, mow the church lawn, and host priests for a nightcap after a Lenten penitential service.  Being Catholic was part of who we were and now looking back I realize how unique this experience was for someone who’s a part of Generation X.
            </p>
            <p>
              I liked school, especially playing competitive sports in junior and senior high school, and so it was no surprise when I earned my education degree at the U of A and began teaching school.  My interest in religion led to theological studies that culminated in getting my doctorate in religious education at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, D.C., in 2011.  I was pleased to be hired at St. Joseph’s College at UAlberta because, as an undergraduate, I had hung out at the small college: a farm kid seeking out a supportive, faith-engaged community--like the one I was raised in.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the College asked me to add “Sport and Religion” to my teaching schedule, I was stunned--”You want me to take the two things I like most and teach them to undergrads. Really?!?” My interest in this field has grown and I incorporate this area of study into my work as a religious educator.  Looking back, I feel lucky and blessed to have landed where I am, to work at the College and University, to think and talk about religion, sport, and education all day.  That’s really cool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, I couldn’t be who I am without the support of my family--my wife, Crystal, my parents and in-laws, my own children, and the different communities I am a part of.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s me in a nutshell, minus my love of biking, pretending to be a handyman, and lack of ability to speak French.
