        <p class="lede">Why take one of my courses?</p>

        <p>I’m personable and professional. I want students to succeed: to learn the course content and see how it can impact their world.  Call me "Matt" or “Dr. Hoven.”</p>

        <h1>Here’s some reasons for enrolling in one of my courses:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I teach about interesting things.</li>
          <li>Smaller class sizes and my commitment to engaging student learning means that you won't be bored.</li>
          <li>I make it relevant.</li>
          <li>I teach a lot of great people--you’ll like meeting them.</li>
          <li>I trust that you want to learn; I encourage you to reflect and discuss in class.</li>
          <li>I work hard and put a lot into my planning.</li>
          <li>I’m open to all students--you need not be a certain kind of student to take my classes or to do well.</li>
          <li>My assignments are meaningful, connecting the course content to real life.</li>
          <li>My assignments aren’t just academic papers--I assess through a variety of methods.</li>
          <li>Course readings are manageable, interesting, and challenge your thinking.</li>
          <li>I bring in guest speakers.</li>
          <li>I get repeat offenders, along with relatives and friends of former students.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Because I teach at a Catholic College, we do talk about religion. I find the subject fascinating, and like that we get a safe space to talk about it at the university. I teach from a Catholic Christian perspective, yet also try to draw from other Christian traditions and even touch upon other religions. I like to hear about my students’ religious backgrounds--including religious nones. I can teach students better when I know more about them and their interests.
        </p>

        <p class="lede">In short, my teaching is better than a slapshot to the face!</p>

        <p>
          Here’s where I was going to cherry pick some complimentary comments from former students, but I’ll save you from that.  You’ll have to trust me, go on <a href="https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/">Beartracks</a>, and enroll!
