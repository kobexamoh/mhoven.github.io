        <p class="lede">Call me “Matt” or “Dr. Hoven,” either works for me.</p>

        <p>Why take one of my courses? I’m personable and professional. I want students to succeed: to learn the course content and see how it can impact their world.</p>

        <h1>Based on what students tell me, here’s reasons for enrolling in one of my courses:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I teach about interesting things.</li>
          <li>I am dedicated to engaging the student learner.</li>
          <li>I am dedicated to engaging the student learner.</li>
          <li>I make things relevant. I work hard and put a lot into my planning.</li>
          <li>I teach a lot of great people—you’ll like meeting them. (Did I mention smaller class sizes at the College?)</li>
          <li>I trust that you want to learn; I encourage you to reflect and discuss in class.</li>
          <li>I’m open to all students—you need not be a certain kind of student or person to take my classes and do well.</li>
          <li>My assignments are meaningful, connecting the course content to real life.</li>
          <li>My assignments aren’t just academic papers—I assess through a variety of methods.</li>
          <li>I choose course readings that are manageable, interesting, and that challenge your thinking.</li>
          <li>I bring in guest speakers.</li>
          <li>I get repeat offenders, along with relatives and friends of former students.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="aside">
         (In my College courses, we talk about religion and spirituality. I find the area fascinating, and value the fact that we get a safe space to talk about it at the university. As an act of full disclosure, I state my religious perspective for students while I also draw from other Christian traditions, even touching upon other religions. Given my work in qualitative studies, I like to understand my students’ religious backgrounds—including religious nones. I can teach students better when I know more about them and their interests.)
        </p>

        <p class="lede">In short, my teaching is better than a slapshot to the face!</p>

        <p>
          Here’s where I was going to cherry pick some complimentary comments from former students, but I’ll save you from that. You’ll have to trust me, go on <a href="https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/">Beartracks</a>, and enroll!
