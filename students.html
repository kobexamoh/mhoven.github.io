        <p class="lede">Call me “Matt” or “Dr. Hoven.” Either works.</p>

        <p>Why take one of my courses? I’m personable and professional. I want students to succeed: to learn the course content and see how it can impact their world.</p>

        <h1>Based on what students tell me, here’s reasons for enrolling in my courses:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>I teach about interesting things.</li>
          <li>I am dedicated to engaging the student learner.</li>
          <li>I make things relevant. I work hard and put a lot into my planning.</li>
          <li>I teach a lot of great people—you’ll like meeting them. (Did I mention smaller class sizes at the College?)</li>
          <li>I trust that you want to learn; I encourage you to reflect and discuss in class.</li>
          <li>I’m open to all students—you need not be a certain kind of student or person to take my classes and do well.</li>
          <li>My assignments are meaningful, connecting the course content to real life.</li>
          <li>My assignments aren’t just academic papers—I assess through a variety of methods.</li>
          <li>I choose course readings that are manageable, interesting, and that challenge your thinking.</li>
          <li>I make connections to Indigenous Peoples and cultures.</li>
          <li>I bring in guest speakers.</li>
          <li>I get repeat offenders, along with relatives and friends of former students.</li>
        </ul>

          If you want to know what courses I’m teaching in the near future, click this link to <a href="http://www.stjosephs.ualberta.ca/AcademicProgram.aspx">the College’s webpage</a>. You can click on my latest course outlines there, or simply <a href="mailto:hoven@ualberta.ca">email me</a> for them. Below is a list of the courses I primarily teach:
        </p>

        <ul class="course-listings hidden">
          <li>
            Sport and Religion (CHRTC 220): This introductory course overviews connections between and new frameworks for understanding sport and religion. My goal is for students to see sport in a new light, making them rethink the place of sport in their lives. What can I say, it’s a great course.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sport and Lived Faith (CHRTC 309): If you would like to study more about sport and religion, I’ve created a course that focuses on athletes and coaches and how they actually experience religion and spirituality in sport.  What does sport and faith look like in reality? We’ll find out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teaching Religion: Secondary (CHRTC 381): If you plan to teach in religiously-affiliated schools (or in church settings), here’s a fitting course. Students get an overview of a sociology of religion in Canada, gain practical pedagogical skills, and beef up their theological knowledge. I’ll bet you make a friend or two along the way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teaching Religion: Elementary (CHRTC 380): Ditto. This course is similar to the one above, but focused on teaching and learning with children instead of adolescents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduction to Educational Improvement (EDU 511): This and the graduate course below are the first year summer residency courses for the Master’s of Educational Studies (MES) in the Faculty of Education. It’s a super busy three weeks, full of hard work, but that intensity offers professional (and personal) rewards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leadership in Educational Settings (EDU 512): This is paired with the course above.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Theological Education of the Catholic School Teacher (CHRTC 250): This is an introductory theology course for teachers. It’s a solid overview of all things Catholic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although I mostly work with undergraduate students in the Fall and Winter, I have offered graduate reading classes at the College and have been part of doctoral and master’s committees in the Faculty of Education.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I sometimes post videos on YouTube, which include descriptions of my courses. If you want to see them, check them out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-PHZOnNt0r1md5_0eowL0w">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="aside">
          (At the College, my courses include religion and spirituality. I find the area fascinating and appreciate the fact that we get a safe space to talk about it at university. As an act of disclosure, I state my religious perspective for students while I also draw from other Christian traditions and touch upon other religions. Given my work in qualitative studies, I like to understand my students’ religious backgrounds—including religious nones. I can teach students better when I know more about them and their interests.)
        </p>

        <p class="lede">
          In short, my teaching is better than a slapshot to the face!
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s where I was going to cherry pick some written endorsements from former students, but I’ll save you from that.  You’ll have to trust me; go on <a href="https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/">"Bear Tracks"</a> and enroll!
